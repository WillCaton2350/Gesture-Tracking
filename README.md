# Gesture-Tracking
Hand tracking in python and opencv 
Adjusts the volume by changing the distance between landmark[4] and landmark[8]; your pointer finger and thumb. This script utilizes the osascript, opencv, cvzone, math, and os modules. The bounding box surrounds the hand after being detected by the camera and monitors the change in volume over time.
(Latest push has a PyQt6 GUI attatched to the OpenCv program)
