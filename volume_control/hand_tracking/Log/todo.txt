{Updates}

After creating the hand tracking module and identifying the thumb and pointer finger with the 4 and 8 values
We calculated the center point and the distance between the 4th and 8th lanmark

{Next}

- Install PyCaw to map the landmarks to the volume control slider.
 * use osascript instead of PyCaw.(PyCaw is windows exclusive)
✅ - Use a bounding box instead of the linear connections between individual landmark points
- I need to configure the hand detector variable from the HandTrackingModule in cvzone to be triggered by a certain hand gesture
 * landmark[8] = start_listener
 * landmark[8]+ landmark[12] = stop_listener or freeze last landmark placement within the pixels
- Detect the speed of landmark[0]
 * if landmark[0] is removed from the frame at 10px per second
  ** Recognize this as landmark[0] leaving the frame and not the user setting a new volume 
   *** freezes or sleeps the camera untill landmark[0] is identified
- Instead of landmark[4] and landmark[8] 
 * I can set it the vol to 0 when every landmark is triggered; the equivalent to a closed fist
 * it can be a sub setting within the force feature
 * or it can be apart of the conditional, and addition to landmark[4] and landmark[8]
- Any kind of freeze conditional trigger/hand sign 

{$Pointers}
- You dont need imshow() to run the script. It isn't like root.mainloop(). It only displays the camera.
 ✅ * Remove imshow() function
